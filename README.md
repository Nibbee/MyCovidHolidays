## JavaScript Style Guide

### General instructions
Make sure the code compiles, follow the style guide, and work properly.

### Style Guide
1. All code should be written in English
2. Commenting code:
   - All comments should be written in English.
   - Code comments should be descriptive and useful but unnecessary and obvious commenting should be avoided.
   - Commented out code should be cleared for the final implementation.
3. Each code file shall have a header that includes: Title, author(s) and a short description
about what the code does.
4. Naming variables:
   - exampleVariable
   - All names must start with a letter
   - Variable names should be descriptive (for example int x, int k, int temp are not
good).
   - Avoid global variables (unless otherwise instructed).
5. Naming functions:
   - exampleFunction()
   - Variable names should be descriptive (for example temp() is not good).
6. Naming files:
   - All filenames should be in lowercase (since some web servers are case sensitive).
   - Spaces shouldnâ€™t be used in filenames (instead use hyphen to separate words).
   - example-file.js.
7. Variable initialization:
   - Always initialize variables.
   - For example initialize variable as 0 unless some other value is more reasonable.
8. Spaces around operators:
   - Put spaces around operators, such as = + - * /.
   - For example let x = y + z;
9. Statement rules:
   - End simple statements with semicolon
   - Complex statements should declared inside brackets and ended with semicolon
after closing brace.
10. Indent code
11. Make sure the code is well structured, readable, and easily understandable. Keep code as
simple as possible.
    - Keep lines short enough for readability.
    - Break statements after operator or comma.
12. Loading JavaScript in HTML
    - Use simple syntax for loading external script
